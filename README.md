**GurnerScheme** - This program implements 
Gorner's scheme for dividing polynomials by binomials and calculating 
the coefficients of the polynomial part and the remainder. The result is output 
as the coefficient of the polynomial and the remainder. Input parameters: 
The coefficients of the polynomial, the value of ξ, which is the free 
The divisible polynomial term (x- ξ). The program includes a check
the correctness of the calculations through multiplication.


**GraphSolofEqu** - This program allows you to graphically determine the upper and lower bounds of the roots 
of the equation and allows you to check the validity of the theorem about the separation of the roots.

**FourierTransform(Direct and inverse Fourier transform based on 
multiplication by the Fourier transform matrix)** - This program implements the forward and inverse Fourier transform based on multiplication by Fourier transform matrix. Provide for the ability to  to choose the size of the transform sequence without  without recompiling the program, the size of the sequence is N , where N=2^n, n=1,2,3,.. .

**IterationMethod** - This program solves systems of linear equations on a set of real numbers by 
iterations. You can solve equations of various orders without 
recompiling the program. The input data (matrix of the coefficients 
of the equation, vector of right sides), are entered into the program from the console

**SplineInterpolation** - This program allows you to find the approximation of a function defined in equidistant points, i.e. a function 
defined as a sequence of numbers, with the help of the spline of third 
degree. In doing so, you can select 
the size of the sequence of conversions without recompiling the program, 
the size of sequence N, where N=5,6,7... 
> A **Spline** is a function which, together with several derivatives 
is continuous on the whole given interval [a,b], and on each partial interval [xi, xi+1] separately is some algebraic polynomial. 
The degree of the spline is the maximum degree of the polynomials on all partial intervals 
degree of the polynomial, and the defect of the spline is the difference between the degree of the spline and the 
order of the largest continuous derivative on [a,b].
